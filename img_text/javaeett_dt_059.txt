Description of the illustration jeett_dt_059.eps
================================================

This figure shows a batch job that contains two chunk steps, a task step
and a decision element. The job starts with chunk step A, continues with
chunk step B, and then decision element D evaluates condition 1. The
condition is based on the status of step B. If condition 1 is true, the
job terminates; otherwise the job continues with step C and then the job
ends.
